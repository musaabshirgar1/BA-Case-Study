##   Project Overview

WellFitAI is an AI-driven fitness application that provides users with real-time motion tracking, personalized workout routines, and AI-driven calorie and hydration tracking. The application is designed to support wearable devices and offer multi-platform access, making fitness tracking convenient and data-driven. This project follows an Agile approach to the requirements gathering lifecycle, as outlined in the case study.

##   Deliverables

This section describes each deliverable submitted as part of the case study.

###   Deliverable 1: Project Proposal and Vision

* **Part 1: The Proposal Presentation**

    * A short presentation outlining the proposed WellFitAI solution. This presentation introduces the core concept of the application, its target users, and its key features.
* **Part 2: Project Vision**

    * A document defining the project vision for WellFitAI. This document details the app plan to elicit and define requirements, including the business idea, product definition, target users (personas), and potential features and functions based on assumed business needs.

###   Workshop 1: Low-Fidelity Mockups (Sketches)

* A set of low-fidelity mockups (sketches) outlining a main workflow of the WellFitAI application on a mobile device. The mockups are arranged into a storyboard to visualize the user flow.

###   Workshop 2: Mid-Fidelity Prototype

* A set of mid-fidelity mockups created using a UX tool (e.g., Balsamiq) for a second main workflow of the WellFitAI application, designed for a tablet device. These mockups are also arranged into a storyboard.

###   Deliverable 3: System Requirements

* A system requirements specification document that translates the business requirements into system requirements. This document includes use cases, user stories, and mid-fidelity mockups.

###   Deliverable 4: Requirements Design

* A clickable hi-fidelity mockup storyboard demonstrating two key functions of WellFitAI.
* A 10-minute video demonstrating the hi-fidelity storyboard.
